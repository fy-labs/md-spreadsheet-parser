### 🐛 Bug Fixes

When YAML frontmatter has a `title` AND actual H1 headers exist in the document, the frontmatter is now treated as a Document section instead of the workbook root. The H1 header is used for workbook auto-detection as usual. Previously, frontmatter `title` unconditionally preempted H1 auto-detection, causing 0 sheets to be parsed when both coexisted.
